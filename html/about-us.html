    <h1>Welcome to Cafe Finder Copenhagen</h1>
    <p>Discover and explore cafes in Copenhagen. Browse our list of cafes to find your favorite spots for coffee, pastries, and more.</p>
    <p>We're a group of students, who were tired of never knowing where to go for studying. <br>So we took matters into our own hands, and built this website!</p>
    <p>We took a minimalistic approach, using few tools to actually make the website. Due to it being a hobby project, the website keeps it
        <br>to a simple design and function. We provided what's needed, but are always open for ideas and other types of inquiries.
        <br></br>We're always trying to improve the website, but since we're doing it in our freetime, please have patience with potential fixes and add-ons.
    </p>
    <p>Copenhagen is rich of cafes and places to sit and relax. So explore the website, and provide feedback if you have any.</p>
